# spreadSheet

-Updates in the last commit (by sameer)

User must press Enter key to enter some value in a cell (switch into editing mode)

User can't navigate using keys unless they leave editing mode by pressing enter again

the arrow keys will only work for the text inside the cell while it is in editing mode

the previous input element is changed to div, text can be entered using 'contentEditable' attribute of div element

-Currently working on:

Parsing formula entered by user eg: '=E1+D2*C3' , the resulting expression will look something like '23+56*9'

mistakes to be rectified -
1)column number is not correctly assigned for 11 th row 0-10 columns recheck required for its formula (is it rectified???)

current works -

postponed works -
1)resizing the cell sizes with double click or like so

Specialities -
1)can navigate throughout the sheet with arrow keys
